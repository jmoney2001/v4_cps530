            <h3>- After the initial hump, it is rather easy to create pages with it. Almost by definition, frameworks exist to make programmer's lives easier, so while simpler web pages would be easier to create with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, more complicated front-end work is definitely made easier using frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, etc. </h3>

            <h3>- We would not have done things differently in retrospect. Using frameworks definitely made things harder at first, but much more rewarding after the initial hurdle.</h3>

            <h3>- We do not regret our choice of frameworks at all. React, Express, Node are very popular within the industry, so this was a great opportunity to really practice these skills.</h3>
